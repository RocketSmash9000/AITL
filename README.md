# I Am The Level
Here you will find every beta version I made so far.

You can include my game wherever you want, but you must give credit

I will (eventually (or not)) get my game into Steam if it gets enough support. 

## Important
Feel free to download and play the game from here but bear in mind that this project repo only contains versions that may have unpatched bugs, bad/unstable performance and/or unfinished features.

## Controls
- Use WASD to move
- Use Q/E to rotate
- Use Numpad Enter to get to the credits
- Controller support since v0.1.2-beta

## System requirements
- Any Windows/Linux/MacOS version (havenâ€™t tested versions below XP).
- At least 1GB of RAM for it to run smoothly.
- A PC.
- A player.
- GEFORCE/NVIDIA GTX/RTX 650 (can be lower. Use carefully as it might cause an fps drop).
- A keyboard and a mouse (or a controller for v0.1.2 or higher).

Use of headsets is recommended but not necessary.
