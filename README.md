# IATL
Here you will find every release and beta I made so far.

You can include my game wherever you want, but you must give credit

I will (eventually) get my game into Steam if it has enough support here. 

## Controls
- Use WASD to move
- Use Q/E to rotate
- Use Numpad Enter to get to the credits
- Controller is also supported since v0.1.2-beta

## System requirements
- Any Windows version (XP or higher).
- At least 1GB of RAM for it to run smooth.
- A PC.
- A player.
- GEFORCE/NVIDIA GTX/RTX 650 (can be lower. Use carefully as it might be unstable).
- A keyboard and a mouse (or a controller).

A headset is recommended.
